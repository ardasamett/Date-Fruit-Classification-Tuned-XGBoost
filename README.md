# üçì Date-Fruit Classification | Tuned XGBoost üçì

In this notebook, I did classification by tuning the parameters of the xgboost algorithm.

## Why did I choose this dataset?

A popular dataset where I can implement machine learning classification algorithms.

## What was my aim and did I succeed?

I've been interested in deep learning for a while. I started doing simple projects like this so as not to forget the machine learning implementation.

## What could I have done better ? (TO-DO)

* Model can be optimized with different hyperparameters. 
* A better result can be obtained with AutoML.
* Apart from Accuracy, other metrics should also be checked.


## What did I learn from this analysis?
* I practiced machine learning implementation
